	<p>Respected Sir,<br>    I am writing this letter to seek your permission for a Codecamp organised by Devsnest at Tomorrowland, Belgium. The codecamp will start on 29/05/2021<sup>(i.e. Sunday)</sup> and end on 27/06/2021<sub>(i.e. Sunday)</sub>. The codecamp is of 30 days. Attending the codecamp will help me code better, create better logics and solutions to coding problems. As my goal is to become a Data scientist, I want your permission to let me attend the 30 day camp. It will make achieving my dream a piece of cake for me. Also while I will be gone I want you to ensure that I don't get marked as absent in any class. I leave my <b>attendance</b> to you. Please make sure my attendance doesn't falls short than <em>75%</em> you little <strong>weakling</strong> and <i>grades</i> will be decided on the basis of my perfomance on codecamp. Your college is going to pay the <i>bills</i> for flights, hotels and everything else. And if you ignore my request, you will suffer my <strong>wrath</strong>. Wrath of the <strong>demon lord</strong> includes:<br>
	<ol>
		<li>I will <i>shred</i> you to pieces.</li>
		<li>You will be <i>vapourised</i>.</li>
	</ol>
	Also I'm telling you what number you will alot me in the subjects:
	<table><tr><th>Subject</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><th>c++</th><th>60</th></tr><tr><th>electronics</th><th>60</th></tr></table>
	<br>I eagerly await your positive response --weakling.<br><br>Your lord<br>Ghost<br><br>
